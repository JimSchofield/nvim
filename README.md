# Neovim setup

To install, clone into `~/.config/`.  This repo is meant to completely replace a config, and should probably not be combined with other setups.

*Note:* Packer needs to be installed (https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
And then run: `:PackerInstall`

Restarting a few times might be necessary
